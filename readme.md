# Habits and becoming proficient

I strongly believe that becoming an expert in some field requires time and curiosity to be put it the area of interest.

I also understand that to do something over time, I cannot rely on motivation. It comes and goes. What I have to rely on is a power of habit.

## Trust the process

I will spend at least 25 minutes, everyday, pushing my capabilities of capturing value with Rust programming language forward.
